 <h3><a name="me"> </a>Me</h3>
 <p>I'm pretty sure you know me already, but my name is Yoocee Direntwi Ansah. "Mark" was once part of my fullname, but that's a rather long <br />
    and confusing story. I was born on 22nd October, 2000 at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra to Eunice and William Ansah. Okay so I'm<br />
	21 years old (not that it matters or anything). I'm about 5'11" tall. I'm slender and dark in complexion. I also wear glasses. I live with<br />
	my parents at New Gbawe, far away from most of my friends. I miss them a lot on vacations but it's not as bad as it sounds though. It's <br />
	really quiet and I kinda like it. I want to move to an estate that's just as quiet one day, but it has to be closer to where some of my <br />
	friends are, so I can host and visit them on occasions.</p>
 
 <h3><a name="looks"> What Do I Look Like? </a></h3>
 <p> Well this is what I look like;</p>

 <h3><a name="current_info"></a>Current Information</h3>
 <p>I'm a final year computer engineering student at KNUST</p>
 
 <h3><a name="interests"></a>Interests</h3>
 <p>I <strong>love</strong> football. I'm a Chelsea fan. #KTBFFH. I LOVE most animals, especially dogs. They're man's best friends. I started <br />
    warming up to cats recently but I doubt they'll ever trump my unending love for dogs. I'm terrified to death of any and every venomous <br />
	creature that walks this planet. That includes snakes, scorpions, some species of spiders, komodo dragons and women. Haha. That was a joke. <br />
	Basically I'm scared of anything that could kill me for sport. Anyway, my favourite breed of dogs is the German Shepherd. I'd like to get one <br />
	in future and pair it with a golden retriever. I'll take absolutely good care of them with my would-be wife/girlfriend in our lovely home one day. </p>
